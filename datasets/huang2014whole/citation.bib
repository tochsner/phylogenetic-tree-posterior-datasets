 abstract = {As molecular phylogenetic analyses incorporate ever‐greater numbers of loci, cases of cytonuclear discordance–the phenomenon in which nuclear gene trees deviate significantly from organellar gene trees–are being reported more frequently. Plant examples of topological discordance, caused by recent hybridization between extant species, are well known. However, examples of branch‐length discordance are less reported in plants relative to animals. We use a combination of de novo assembly and reference‐based},
