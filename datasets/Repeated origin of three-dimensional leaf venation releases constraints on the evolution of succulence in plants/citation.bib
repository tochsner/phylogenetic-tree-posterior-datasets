 abstract = {Succulent water storage is a prominent feature among plants adapted to arid zones, but we know little about how succulence evolves and how it is integrated into organs already tasked with multiple functions. Increased volume in succulent leaves, for example, may result in longer transport distances between veins and the cells that they supply, which in turn could negatively impact photosynthesis [1â€“4]. We quantified water storage [5] in a group of 83 closely related species to examine the evolutionary dynamics of succulence and leaf},
