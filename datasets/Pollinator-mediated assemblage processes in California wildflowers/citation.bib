 abstract = {Community assembly is the result of multiple ecological and evolutionary forces that influence species coexistence. For flowering plants, pollinators are often essential for plant reproduction and establishment, and pollinator‐mediated interactions may influence plant community composition. Here, we use null models and community phylogenetic analyses of co‐occurrence patterns to determine the role of pollinator‐mediated processes in structuring plant communities dominated by congeners. We surveyed three species‐rich genera},
