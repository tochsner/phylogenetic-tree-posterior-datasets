 abstract = {PREMISE With over 1500 species, the globally distributed Vernonieae is one of the most successful members of the largest family of flowering plants, the Compositae. However, due to its morphological complexity and limited geographic representation in previous studies, subtribal and biogeographic relationships are unclear. Here, new DNA sequence data spanning the geographic range of the tribe provides a taxonomically robust time‐calibrated phylogeny, estimates migration pathways and timing of important biogeographic events, and},
