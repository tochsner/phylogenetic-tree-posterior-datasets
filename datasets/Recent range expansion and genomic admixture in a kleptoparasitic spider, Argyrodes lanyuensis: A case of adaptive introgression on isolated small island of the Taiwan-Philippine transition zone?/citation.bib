 abstract = {Adaptive introgression involves the acquisition of advantageous genetic variants through hybridisation, which are subsequently favoured by natural selection due to their association with beneficial traits. Here, we analysed speciation patterns of the kleptoparasitic spider, Argyrodes lanyuensis, through genomic analyses and tested for possible genetic evidence of adaptive introgression at the Taiwan–Philippines transition zone. Our study used highly polymorphic SNPs to demonstrate that speciation occurred when the Hualien (on Taiwan},
