 abstract = {Body size affects numerous aspects of organismal biology and many factors have been invoked to explain body size distributions in a macroecological and macroevolutionary context. Body size in the freshwater fish family Percidae is strongly right-skewed (ie dominated by small sizes), with small body size potentially being associated with fast water habitats. We constructed a new species-level, multi-locus, time-calibrated phylogeny of Percidae, and used it to test for changes in the rate and pattern of maximum body size},
