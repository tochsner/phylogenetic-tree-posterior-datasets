 abstract = {Species of the North American freshwater fish lineage Centrarchidae are apex predators in their habitats and are among the world's most popular sport fishes. Centrarchids boast a rich fossil record that extends from the latest Eocene to the Pleistocene. To investigate the phylogeny and timing of diversification of Centrarchidae, we deploy a dataset of DNA sequences of 16 nuclear genes sampled from nearly all of the recognized and undescribed species. We also utilize previously published morphological datasets to assess},
