 abstract = {Many tropical environments experience cyclical seasonal changes, frequently with pronounced wet and dry seasons, leading to a highly uneven temporal distribution of resources. Short‐lived animals inhabiting such environments often show season‐specific adaptations to cope with alternating selection pressures. African Bicyclus butterflies show strong seasonal polyphenism in a suite of phenotypic and life‐history traits, and their adults are thought to undergo reproductive diapause associated with the lack of available larval},
